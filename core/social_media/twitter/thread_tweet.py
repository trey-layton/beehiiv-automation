        You are a brilliant social media copywriter tasked with managing the social media accounts of the most brilliant, talented creators in the world. 
        Generate a list of 5-7 tweets summarizing the main takeaways from the newsletter. Each tweet must be a maximum of 280 characters. Here is an example:
        tweet 1: "A professional sports gambler used analytics to turn a $700,000 loan into more than $300 million.

This is the wild story ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡"

2: "1) Let's start with some history...

Matthew Benham graduated from the world-renowned University of Oxford in 1989 with a degree in Physics.

He spent the next 12 years working in finance, eventually being named a VP at Bank of America.

But in 2001, he decided to change careers."

3. "2) After leaving Bank of America in 2001, Matthew Benham joined sports gambling company Premier Bet.

His job was to help develop predictive gambling models based on analytics. 

The best part?

Benham learned under one of the most successful gamblers in the world â€” Tony Bloom."

4. "3) After only a couple years, Matthew Benham and Tony Bloom had a falling out.

The exact reason why isn't clear, but by the time Benham left Premier Bet in 2003, the fire was already lit.

He wasn't going back to investment banking.

He was a professional sports gambler now."

5. "4) Matthew Benham went on to win millions of dollars gambling on sports, but in 2004, he set up his own betting syndicate â€” Smartodds.

The idea was simple:

Benham consulted clients using the same algorithms, statistics & data research that made him a successful sports gambler."
        Then, after you've created the entire complete thread, attach these two tweets to the end:
            1. A tweet with the article link: "If you want to go even deeper, check out the full article! [article_url]"
            2. A call-to-action tweet: "If you found value in this thread, please give it a like and share!" 
        Return your answer as a JSON object with numbered keys (1., 2., 3., 4., 5., 6., 7.) for each tweet.
    Remember, there should be more than just one reply tweet... At least 4 of these. Emulate the writer's actual social media style (tone, syntax, punctuation, etc) as seen in these examples classified by type of newsletter. Here's the newsletter content: {text} Use this article link in the article tweet: {web_url}.
        Each thread should be no less than 5 posts per thread. Do not return any additional text other than the JSON object.
        Here is an example of how it should be structured:
        Example:
        {
            "type": "thread_tweet",
            "content": [
                {"type": "main_tweet", "content": "Main post content here"},
                {"type": "reply_tweet", "content": "Reply content here"},
                {"type": "reply_tweet", "content": "Reply content here"},
                {"type": "article_url", "content": "If you want to go even deeper, check out the full article! [article_url]"},
                {"type": "quote_tweet", "content": "If you found value in this thread, please give it a like and share!"},
            ]

        }
        """
}

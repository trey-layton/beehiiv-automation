This is the wild story ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡"

2: "1) Let's start with some history...

Matthew Benham graduated from the world-renowned University of Oxford in 1989 with a degree in Physics.

He spent the next 12 years working in finance, eventually being named a VP at Bank of America.

But in 2001, he decided to change careers."

3. "2) After leaving Bank of America in 2001, Matthew Benham joined sports gambling company Premier Bet.

His job was to help develop predictive gambling models based on analytics. 

The best part?

Benham learned under one of the most successful gamblers in the world â€” Tony Bloom."

4. "3) After only a couple years, Matthew Benham and Tony Bloom had a falling out.

The exact reason why isn't clear, but by the time Benham left Premier Bet in 2003, the fire was already lit.

He wasn't going back to investment banking.

He was a professional sports gambler now."

5. "4) Matthew Benham went on to win millions of dollars gambling on sports, but in 2004, he set up his own betting syndicate â€” Smartodds.

The idea was simple:

Benham consulted clients using the same algorithms, statistics & data research that made him a successful sports gambler."

There is a proven playbook to grow companies.

The best entrepreneurs have a series of plays they run to print money. What tools to use, agencies to hire, strategies to employ.

Here is the exact 12 step strategy I've used to grow 3+ companies to millions in annual profit:

#1 - New logo with 99 designs. It costs $299 and is good enough for me.

#2 - New website by http://webrun.com. They've built 5 of my websites.

Whoever you chose, make sure it is SEO optimized and has landing pages for each of your services and each location.

KEEP IT SIMPLE.

A person who knows nothing about your business should be able to become your customer in 5 minutes or less.

#3 - Overseas talent hired through http://supportshepherd.com.

$5 an hour can get you an excellent back office employee. Game changer.

80% of my employees at a SELF STORAGE company are overseas. From management to financial underwriting to customer service.

You would be surprised how much can be managed and done from afar.

#4 - A Google Business profile you check and post on every single day. And you get all of your customers to write you a review.

This is a game changer as well and low hanging fruit.

#5 - Google ads running with http://adrhino.com.

Make sure you hire a company that can setup Google Analytics 4 and  track how the ads convert to customers.

You should get an ad spend amount per customer acquired so you can track profitability.

#6 - Link building plan to increase domain authority and Google ranking with http://boldseo.com.

The website structured correctly, content and these links are what will work for you.

Make sure to do "citations" as well with your name, address, phone number that list your company on all the directory sites like Yelp, Angies list, Yellow pages and more.

#7 - Make sure to get a premium .com domain for a few thousand bucks with less than 13 characters.

English words. Not .co. Not .net. Not .io.

People invest thousands into their business but make due with a $19 domain wit hyphens. Makes no sense.

#8 - Online banking with relayFi or Mercury. It is easy to send money and get cards for all your employees.

Don't accept cash or check. It is a waste of time and money. And people will steal it.

#9 - An online software to run your business. Jobber or another one like it.

A customer should be able to log in and pay an invoice in 2 minutes.

And you should be able to send them a professional invoice and take auto-payment for services.

#10 - Payroll tools like Deel (international) and Gusto make it super easy to run payroll.

#11 - Bookkeeping and tax returns through http://BetterBookkeeping.com.

I use them and they are awesome. Send monthly reports and prep tax returns.

#12 - Slack for communication. Loom for sharing training videos. Avoma for recording meetings. Notion for recording information and organizing data.

It's a cheat code to have these vendors to amplify my companies.

(I'm a partner in several of these companies - you don't need to use the exact ones I mention - just hire somebody good)

What do you have in your tech stack that I'm missing?

What tools do you love that I didn't share?

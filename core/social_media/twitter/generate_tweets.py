Matthew Benham graduated from the world-renowned University of Oxford in 1989 with a degree in Physics.

He spent the next 12 years working in finance, eventually being named a VP at Bank of America.

But in 2001, he decided to change careers."

3. "2) After leaving Bank of America in 2001, Matthew Benham joined sports gambling company Premier Bet.

His job was to help develop predictive gambling models based on analytics. 

The best part?

Benham learned under one of the most successful gamblers in the world â€” Tony Bloom."

4. "3) After only a couple years, Matthew Benham and Tony Bloom had a falling out.

The exact reason why isn't clear, but by the time Benham left Premier Bet in 2003, the fire was already lit.

He wasn't going back to investment banking.

He was a professional sports gambler now."

5. "4) Matthew Benham went on to win millions of dollars gambling on sports, but in 2004, he set up his own betting syndicate â€” Smartodds.

The idea was simple:

Benham consulted clients using the same algorithms, statistics & data research that made him a successful sports gambler."

The best entrepreneurs have a series of plays they run to print money. What tools to use, agencies to hire, strategies to employ.

Here is the exact 12 step strategy I've used to grow 3+ companies to millions in annual profit:

#1 - New logo with 99 designs. It costs $299 and is good enough for me.

#2 - New website by http://webrun.com. They've built 5 of my websites.

Whoever you chose, make sure it is SEO optimized and has landing pages for each of your services and each location.

KEEP IT SIMPLE.

A person who knows nothing about your business should be able to become your customer in 5 minutes or less.

#3 - Overseas talent hired through http://supportshepherd.com.

$5 an hour can get you an excellent back office employee. Game changer.

80% of my employees at a SELF STORAGE company are overseas. From management to financial underwriting to customer service.

You would be surprised how much can be managed and done from afar.

#4 - A Google Business profile you check and post on every single day. And you get all of your customers to write you a review.

This is a game changer as well and low hanging fruit.

#5 - Google ads running with http://adrhino.com.

Make sure you hire a company that can setup Google Analytics 4 and  track how the ads convert to customers.

You should get an ad spend amount per customer acquired so you can track profitability.

#6 - Link building plan to increase domain authority and Google ranking with http://boldseo.com.

The website structured correctly, content and these links are what will work for you.

Make sure to do "citations" as well with your name, address, phone number that list your company on all the directory sites like Yelp, Angies list, Yellow pages and more.

#7 - Make sure to get a premium .com domain for a few thousand bucks with less than 13 characters.

English words. Not .co. Not .net. Not .io.

People invest thousands into their business but make due with a $19 domain wit hyphens. Makes no sense.

#8 - Online banking with relayFi or Mercury. It is easy to send money and get cards for all your employees.

Don't accept cash or check. It is a waste of time and money. And people will steal it.

#9 - An online software to run your business. Jobber or another one like it.

A customer should be able to log in and pay an invoice in 2 minutes.

And you should be able to send them a professional invoice and take auto-payment for services.

#10 - Payroll tools like Deel (international) and Gusto make it super easy to run payroll.

#11 - Bookkeeping and tax returns through http://BetterBookkeeping.com.

I use them and they are awesome. Send monthly reports and prep tax returns.

#12 - Slack for communication. Loom for sharing training videos. Avoma for recording meetings. Notion for recording information and organizing data.

It's a cheat code to have these vendors to amplify my companies.

(I'm a partner in several of these companies - you don't need to use the exact ones I mention - just hire somebody good)

What do you have in your tech stack that I'm missing?

What tools do you love that I didn't share?

If you found this helpful - give me a retweet or a comment - it helps me spread the word!"""

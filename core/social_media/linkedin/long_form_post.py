        You are a skilled ghostwriter creating an engaging long-form LinkedIn post for a top professional.

        Follow these guidelines:
        1. Structure the post with a strong hook at the beginning to capture attention.
        2. Maintain the reader's engagement with short, informative paragraphs.
        3. Keep the tone professional yet approachable, reflecting the professional's unique voice.
        4. Do not use any emojis, excessive punctuation, or overly enthusiastic phrases. Avoid cliches and generic statements.
        5. Focus on providing value, insights, and actionable takeaways based on the content provided.
        6. Ensure that the post flows naturally, keeping the reader interested throughout.
        7. Separate each sentence or paragraph with a blank line to enhance readability.

        How to build a holding company (without millions $$$): 
 
Everyone thinks you need millions of dollars to build a holding company. 
 
At least I did. 
 
Then I built one & realized it's simpler than you think. 
 
Here are the basics: 
 
Building a portfolio of businesses isn't about having millions. 
 
It's about two things: 
• Scale 
• Leverage 
 
Let's break it down: 
 
1. Scale 
 
Start where you are, with what you've got. 
 
Like my pal Ramon. He was an ex-MMA fighter, single dad. His first biz cost $500. About 9yrs later, he says he bought one making 8 figures. 
 
How? Stairstepping. 
 
Stairstepping is like real estate: 
 
First you buy a studio → then a 1 bedroom → Townhouse → House → Multi-family → Industrial 
 
Same in business. 
 
You buy what you can. But you don't bankrupt yourself as you're learning the game. 
 
Then here's the magic: 
 
When you're just starting, people actually WANT to help. So, what can you do? 
• Find people you want to model your baby berkshire after 
• Ask them direct questions. 
 
Congrats. Free board of directors. 
 
Next: 
 
Set timelines. And more importantly – meet expectations. 
 
Your plan might look like: 
"Buy my 1st biz for <$10k in 6mos. Then use the cashflow to buy the 2nd in 3mos." 
 
This is how you start a business flywheel. 
 
Now? Find where other owners & buyers are chilling. 
 
Hit up as many as humanly possible: 
• Send DMs 
• Attend events & conferences 
• Join communities (free first, paid later) 
 
When you surround yourself with owners, you multiply your odds of success. 
 
2. Leverage (aka Other People's Money) 
 
Two main things you need to understand: 
• SBA loans 
• Seller financing 
 
The fastest ways to get equity in things you can't afford with cash. 
 
Leverage is fun, if you can get creative.

Now, once you get the ball rolling: 
 
Find your niches. Double down. 
 
If it works, keep doing it. 
 
Just bigger. 
 
When I first started buying biz's, I kept it simple with laundromats, carwashes, etc. 
 
Then I started buying businesses that helped expand my media company. 
 
Now, I'm making bigger bets, in the millions. And I'm making them publicly. 
 
One recent add to my portfolio: 
 
The home services franchise Resibrands (aka, those beautiful brands in this pic). Making blue collar work cool again & helping regular folks become owners. 
 
But that's not my only recent big bet... 
 
We're also working on something (BIG) that's going to make YOUR holding company easier to build. 
 
Buy your dream & build back Main Street..

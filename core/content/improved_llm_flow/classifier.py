    Drug stores locking up toothpaste is good for Amazon

    Your local pharmacy locking up the toiletries is allowing Amazon to lock down new customers.
    
    Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said Thursday that brick-and-mortar drug stores taking extreme measures to thwart shoplifting have pushed customers to load up their online shopping carts because they don‚Äôt want to ask an employee to unlock a glass case.
    
    There‚Äôs evidence to back up Jassy‚Äôs belief that keeping merchandise under lock and key has hurt IRL stores:
    
    Hundreds of Walgreens, CVS, and Rite Aid locations have closed over the past few years, some of which coincides with when these retailers began believing that Danny Ocean and his crew were coming for their deodorant.
    In a Harris Poll from November 2023, 71% of shoppers said glass cases made them less likely to frequent a store. That figure was 89% among Gen Z respondents.
    In February 2023, Joe Budano, the CEO of anti-theft technology company Indyme, told Axios that the cases can cause sales to drop between 15% and 25%.
    Zoom out: Despite this sales bump for Amazon, its Q2 earnings, announced on Thursday, underwhelmed, and its outlook for Q3 fell short of market expectations. Amazon shares finished down 8.8% yesterday, since even if consumers don‚Äôt like pressing the button that calls for the pharmacy employee with the key, investors are still willing to hit the panic button.‚ÄîDL

    Radioactive drugs strike cancer with precision (15 minute read)
    Radiation therapy has come a long way since X-ray therapy was born in 1896. Targeted radiopharmaceuticals helped the field achieve a new level of molecular precision. These agents deliver their radioactive payloads directly at tumor sites. While there are only a handful of these therapies commercially available for patients, the number is poised to grow as major players in the biopharmaceutical industry start to invest heavily in the technology.
    NASA indefinitely delays return of Starliner to review propulsion data (4 minute read)
    NASA has adjusted the date of the Starliner spacecraft's return to Earth to an unspecified time in July. The spacecraft was originally due to undock and return to Earth on June 14, but return opportunities have been waved off as more time is needed to review the data from the vehicle's problematic flight to the International Space Station. There were five separate leaks in the helium system that pressurizes Starliner's propulsion system and five of the vehicle's 28 reaction-control system thrusters failed as Starliner approached the station. NASA has not specified why it is not yet comfortable with releasing Starliner to fly back to Earth.

    Question to make continuous progress:
    What are the boring, basic actions that you are avoiding right now?
    
    There's a Zen Buddhist saying that changed my life:
    
    "What do you do before enlightenment? Chop wood, carry water. What do you do after enlightenment? Chop wood, carry water."
    
    My interpretation: The internal state may change, but the external action never does.
    
    Every single day, chop wood, carry water.
    
    As you level up and grow, there's a tendency to lose sight of those boring basics that got you there in the first place.
    
    You feel the pull towards complexity (which is a trap!) and start looking for the new actions for the new you.
    
    But as the saying reminds us, you will change, but the actions needn't change with you.
    
    So, what are the boring, basic actions that you are avoiding right now?
    
    How can you chop wood and carry water today?
    
    - Value Prop: Expert-curated, more valuable than just resources. Summarize the expert's main points or recommendations, highlighting their unique insights.
- High-value curation: heavily-researched and data-intensive curation of targeted info (like sponsors for writers or investment opportunities)

    Today, we‚Äôre thrilled to be sitting down with the Founder and CEO of Contractor+, Justin Smith.
    
    Contractor+ is setting out to change the future of the construction industry and they‚Äôve already made quite a dent. Their platform makes it very simple for contractors to operate every part of their business from estimates to payment facilitation and team collaboration. They‚Äôre building AI to save contractors 20+ hours a week with their estimation and project management.
    
    I watched their intro video (below) and came away very impressed. Check out their video on Wefunder as well.
    
    Glad we were able to dive deeper with Justin and ask a few questions.
    
    Let‚Äôs Go!
    
    - Value prop: Hours of effort condensed into one resource for a very specific purpose. Focus on summarizing the key data points, trends, or opportunities identified by the curator.
- Daily analysis: daily analysis of an industry (from a field expert)
    - Example: Milk Road
    
    We‚Äôre focusing on Layer 2s and their tokens, exploring whether they are assets worth investing in right now. üßê
    
    If L2s are a clear contender for the future of blockspace, shouldn't their tokens perform well?
    
    Well, if you have been paying attention to the charts, you might have noticed that L2 tokens look similar to the Terra Luna chart in 2022. üìâ
    
    Ok ok, we are exaggerating, they aren‚Äôt THAT bad. But the last few months haven't been too nice to L2 tokens‚Ä¶ üòÖ

    Hype Matters
    First ‚Äî how could a founder possibly justify that domain expense so early on, especially when they have to also build hardware?
    
    Schiffmann understands that the bar for anyone to care about a consumer product that has a broad target market (lonely people) is incredibly high. It‚Äôs unlike launching a niche consumer product, or b2b product, where there are common threads you can easily pull on to get users excited.
    
    Layer on that it‚Äôs hardware that changes their day-to-day lives, and it takes real gravity to penetrate the cultural zeitgeist to the degree you need to, in order to have staying power.
    
    That‚Äôs why the production quality on the launch video is so high too.
    
    It‚Äôs a high-risk, high-reward moonshot launch ‚Äî you have no choice but to go all-in.
    
    Could he have met that bar without owning [friend.com](http://friend.com/)? Maybe, but:
    
    We‚Äôre talking about it
    
    The price would‚Äôve considerably gone up if he bought it post-launch
    
    He‚Äôs now going to raise a lot more money (more on that below)
    
    I suspect he ‚Äúgets it‚Äù because of his previous viral launches around a COVID-19 tracker during the pandemic and an ‚ÄúAirbnb for Ukraine refugees‚Äù at the beginning of the current war.
    
    Last year I shared my 5-step playbook for how startups create hype.
    
    Schiffmann launched after already going through the first 4 stages and, if the product delivers on user expectations when it ships in Q1 of next year, has a legitimate shot of cracking the fifth as well.
    
    But there‚Äôs a long road between now and then.

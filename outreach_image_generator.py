Resources of the Week
Over 500 jobs on the job board here!

This post from Hailley Griffis who leads Communications and Content at Buffer has some top notch advice on what helped folks stand out in a a pool of 1500 applicants.

How public should you be on social media around your layoff? Check out some considerations here.

Workfolk launched a newsletter where they are highlighting various networking events and other opportunities in the startup space. I shared some tips for growing on LinkedIn as part of the first issue - check it out on LinkedIn!

I was heartbroken to hear about yet another school shooting‚Ä¶this time just about an hour outside of Atlanta where I grew up. Of course there‚Äôs a complex network of things that contribute to gun violence in this country including a lack of social safety nets, poverty, lack of mental health supports, etc. But the number one thing that separates the US from the rest of the world in this area is that we have more guns per capita than any other country.

We have politicians, most of whom have never stepped foot inside of a school, trying to ‚Äúfix‚Äù education by banning books, preventing any sort of education or discussion rooted in DEI, fighting against teaching critical race theory, working to arm teachers in classrooms‚Ä¶anything but addressing the actual issues leading to unprecedented levels of gun violence.

Here‚Äôs a list of actions we can all take as citizens to combat gun violence courtesy of Sandy Hook Promise, and Everytown is also a great resource.

What might falling interest rates mean for the job market?!
You‚Äôve probably heard that there‚Äôs a correlation between interest rates and job creation. Here‚Äôs a high level overview of how that works and what the upcoming drop in interest rates might mean for the market.

When interest rates fall, it‚Äôs cheaper to borrow money which fuels growth and expansion.

On top of that, there‚Äôs less incentive for companies or investors to keep cash on hand when interest rates are lower so it makes more sense for them to focus on investment as a way of expanding their wealth. This can help launch new startups as well who have struggled with raising capital.

People make bigger purchases that require loans when interest rates are lower which can spur job creation in fields like real estate, banking, construction, and the automotive industry.

So should we expect a big surge in the market?

Honestly, I still don‚Äôt think so. We‚Äôre seeing just a small drop and I suspect the powers that be will want to see how things shake out over the next few months with the economy and the election.

All that said, hopefully this will help us move in the right direction - the workforce deserves it!!

P.S. For those who are interested in more on how the job market might impact the election, here‚Äôs an analysis in Reuters based on Goldman Sachs and a fascinating look at how different scenarios may play out from Moody‚Äôs Analytics.


Decided to check out the cherry blossoms this week üôÇ 

Secta is rolling out cool new backgrounds every week it seems! This week, I decided to give cherry blossoms a try - hopefully one day I‚Äôll actually find myself among the cherry blossoms in Japan but until that day, thanks AI! Reminder that they offer us a community discount so if you need new headshots, check them out!

üôãAnswering Your Questionsüôã
Each week, I‚Äôll answer one (or more!) of your questions in this section. You can submit your questions here.

How specific do recruiters and hiring managers actually want you to be during interviews? If I‚Äôm telling a story to highlight my work while answering a question, how much background context and detail should I give?

This is a tough balance because some will ask questions to get what they need and others won‚Äôt. Some prefer lots of details and may see higher level stories as vague, while others will call too much detail ‚Äúrambling‚Äù. So this makes it tough for sure.

Personally, I think sharing a bit of context is important, but you don‚Äôt need to give them a play by play of how you got the situation. For example, ‚ÄúWe realized we needed functionality that our existing CRM did not offer so I was charged with evaluating options, selecting, and driving the implementation of a new CRM‚Äù should be sufficient (vs. going into details of all the issues you were facing with the existing CRM.)

One thing you can do is frame up that you welcome questions. For example, you can say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll try to stay high level here, but I am happy to dive into more specifics around any of these areas‚Äù before you share the story, or you can say, ‚ÄúI know I gave just a quick overview, but let me know what specifics I can expand upon.‚Äù This increases the likelihood that they‚Äôll dive in and get what they need if they didn‚Äôt!
